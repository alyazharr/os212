#### 1. Willing to Study 🔥  
PREPARE your willing and intention to learn about Operating System.   
Well, we can't just rely on the intention to get score and fulfill the required courses.  
Upgrade your insight and intention to explore more and more in OS course.

Spend time from your 24/7 for OS, either it can be to do weekly assignments,  
learning new things, or preparing weekly quiz. It DO REALLY helps when you have an ability  
to manage time properly. With spare at least 1-2 hours/day for learning OS may help you to  
understand the meaning of this course. So. you learn things!  
  
#### 3. Be a Punctual Person ⏲️  
Beside the lessons about the OS course, this course also teach you to not be a DEADLINERS.  
Do not do your weekly assignment close to deadline, no benefits for doing that!  
Do your weekly assignment parts by parts, it really helps. Trust me. You also may need time  
to study for your quiz on the next day.  
  
#### 4. GSGS is the culture 🖥️  
This course teaches us about **GSGS** or **Google Sana Google Sini**.  
Do NOT be lazy to search the solutions for every problems that may happen to you.  
Try to finish it by yourself before you ask the TA or even the lecturer.  
GOOGLE (maybe) provide 99.999% the information that you need, so find it yourself!  
  
#### 5. TAKE attention to the class and READ the SLIDES/BOOKS 📰👨‍🏫  
Eventhough, this course let you decide **how deep you want to learn about OS ?**  
but listening to the class and take notes is really helps you to understand MORE rather just  
read it on book or slides by your own. Read the lessons from slides/books is  
DO REALLY helps for QUIZ and also improve your curiosity about OS, somehow.
